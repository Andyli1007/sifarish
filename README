Introduction
============

Sifarish is a suite of recommendation engines implementaed in Hadoop. Various algorithms, including 
feature similarity based recommendation and collaborative filtering based recommendation using social 
rating data will be available

Similarity Based Recommendation
===============================

In the absence of social rating data, the only options is a feature similarity based recommendation.
Similarity is calculated based on distance between entities in a multi dimensional feature space. Some
examples are - recommending jobs based on user's resume - recommending products based on user profile

Attribute meta data is defined in a json file. Both entities need not have the same set of attributes. 
Mapping between attributes values from one entity to the other can be defined in the config file.

The data type supported are numerical (integer) and categorical. The distnace between categorical attributes 
is is 0 if they are same 1 otherwise. If the atrributes are different, the distance can be configured to be 
something other than. For numerical, the distance is simply the distance between the two values. Numerical 
attributes are normalized using the difference between the min and max values.
 
The distance algorithms can be chosed to be euclidian, manhattan or minkowski. The default algorithm is 
euclidian. The distancs between different atrributes of different types are combined to find distance between
two entity instances. Different weights can be assigned to the attributes to control the relative importance
of different attributes.

Here is an example for a recipe recommendation system configuration. The entities are user profile and recipe.
